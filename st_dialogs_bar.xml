	<string id="story_dolg_1">
		<text>지금 당장 우리는 작전상 네 세력을 적대하고 있다. 프리덤, 모노리스, 용병 그리고 밴딧이지. 그 넷 중에서는, 모노리스와 밴딧이 가장 염려스러운 세력이다. 특히 후자는 점점 더 조직화되고 있는 중이지. 놈들의 숫자뿐만 아니라 놈들의 인간성이 전체적으로 부족하다는 점을 볼 때, 상당한 위협이 될 수 있다.\n \n모노리스 놈들은, 최근 들어 놀랍도록 빠른 속도로 복귀했다. 올해 초부터 놈들의 재림으로 인해 야노프에 있는 우리들의 세력은 약화되었고, 우리는 결국 로스토크의 전반적인 보안 수준을 보장하기 위해 비통한 희생을 감내해야만 했었지.\n \n현재는, 프리덤과 푸르딩딩한 녀석들이 떠나있는 한, 상황은 안정적이다. 하지만 간과하지는 말도록. 어찌되었건 그들은 호적수니까, 우리 스파이들이 반드시 그들을 면밀하게 지켜봐야만 한다. 하지만, 지금 당장은 그들이 우리와 우리 동맹에게 대적하러 오지는 않는 만큼, 우리는 조금 숨통이 트인 셈이지. </text>

		<text>이번에 새로 들어온 신병을 말하는 건가? 대략 5분의 3 정도는 괜찮다고 할 수 있겠군. 완벽하지는 않지만, 끔찍한 수준까지도 아니지. 페트렌코 대령 덕에, 우리에겐 새로운 전사들이 활발하게 유입되고 있지만, 아무래도 지금까지 녀석들이 보여준 상식의 부재에 대해서는 조금 실망했다고 표현할 수밖에는 없다.\n \n좀 더 규율이 잡힌다면 좋으련만, 우리에겐 신병들에게 그 어리석은 전투광스런 면모를 교정해줄 간부들이 부족한 상황이다. 언젠가는, 듀티가 완전히 회복되리라 기대하고 있지만... 아무래도 시간이 걸리겠지.</text>

	<string id="story_dolg_5">
		<text>... 역시 숨길 만한 이유는 없을 것 같군. 우리들의 연결고리는 튼튼하지 못했다. 배신자가 있었지. 모건이라는 어리석은 장교가 있었다. 그 자가 우리가 없애버리고자 했던 바로 그 밴딧 놈들이게 물건을 팔고 있었다는 게 드러났지. 그리고 마치 그보다 더 나쁜 상황이 찾아오지 않을 것처럼, 그 현장을 우리들 듀티가 아니라 한 무리의 중립 소속 스토커들이 잡아내는 데 성공하고 말았다. 그 결과로, 우리들이 잃어버린 신뢰를 되찾기 위해 수 년 동안 노력해야만 했지. 이 모든 게 한 사람의 잘못 때문이었다.\n \n그 때문에 최근 모노리스들이 귀환했을 때 우리들은 끔찍한 상황에 처하고 말았지. 내가 야노프에 파견했던 용감한 지휘관 슐가 중령은 몇 번의 비참한 희생을 감수해야만 했고 결국 그 과정에서 목숨을 잃고 말았다. 그가 이끌었던 분견대 중에서 살아서 로스토크로 돌아온 사람은 가브릴렌코 한 명 뿐이었지.\n \n물론 그 당시에도, 그 불쌍한 친구는 처음 여기 도착했을 때만해도 거의 말을 잇지 못했다네, 그리고 그 친구가 결국 보고했던 내용은... 비참했지. 만약 가브릴렌코를 보게 된다면, 부디 그를 가만히 놔 두게나.</text>

		<text>우리들이 존을 얼마나 증오하는 지에 비추어 본다면 이상해 보일 수도 있겠지만, 우리들 듀티는 과학자들과 각별한 관계를 유지하고 있다. 우리는 지금껏 마주하지 못한 적들과 싸우고 있다. 바로 단순한 군대가 아닌, 흉측하게 변해버린 자연의 힘과 맞서 싸우고 있지. 누구도 아무런 지식 없이는 전쟁에서 이길 수 없고, 특히나 이런 전쟁이면 더더욱 그렇지. 그리고 과학자들이야말로 누구보다 더 우리가 마주할 적들을 잘 알고 있는 사람들이지 않은가? 지금 당장은 과학자들이 그저 순진하게 인류의 번영을 위해 어떻게 존을 이용할지만 신경쓰고 있지만, 그렇다고 그들이 프리덤처럼 잘못된 길로 빠지고 있는 건 아니라고 본다. 언젠간, 그 친구들도 존을 파괴하는 것만이 유일한 해법이라는 것을 깨닫겠지. 과학자들의 훌륭한 지식에 우리 듀티의 용기와 기술이 뒷받침되는 날이 온다면, 그 날이 바로 존의 마지막 날이 될 것이라 확신하고 있다.\n \n 그때까지는, 과학자들에게 필요한 것들을 주는 것이 바로 인류를 위하는 길이라고 할 수 있다. 예를 들자면 그들이 연구할 만한 아티팩트를 기부한다거나, 범죄자들로부터 그들을 지켜줄 경비들을 파견하는 것 말이지. 지금은 잠잠해졌지만, 한때는 프리덤과 용병 놈들이 정부 소속 과학자들에게 시시때때로 총격을 가했던 적이 있었다. 오직 우리들 듀티가 보복할 가능성 하나만으로 세 세력간의 평화를 유지하고 있는 것이지.</text>

		<text>흠, 아무래도 우리 군복에 대해 뭔가 궁금한 게 있는 거 같은데, 아닌가?\n \n어째서 모든 병사들이 검고 붉은 옷을 입은 채로 맨정신으로 전쟁터 속으로 들어가는지 궁금해하고 있는 것 같은데. 잠시만 시간을 내서 우리들의 진정한 적이 누구인가에 대해 생각해 봤으면 좋겠군. 용병? 아니지. 밴딧? 계속 귀찮게 구는 놈들이긴 하지만, 아니다. 프리덤? 꽤나 위험한 놈들이긴 하지만, 정답은 아니다. 모노리스 놈들도 우리들의 진정한 적수라고는 할 수 없지. 진정한 적은 바로 존 그 자체다.\n \n말해 보게나, 과연 위장을 한다고 해서 대기 너머로도 심장소리를 느낄 수 있는 블러드써커를 속일 수 있다고 생각하나? 아니면 냄새나 반향정위를 이용하는 개들은 어떤가? 단지 생각만 읽기만 하면 되는 컨트롤러들에게는 어떨까?\n \n우리들의 진정한 적 앞에서는, 위장은 무용지물이라 할 수 있다. 이런 상황속에서, 나라면 피아식별이 잘 되는 뚜렷한 색깔로 된 옷을 선택할 것 같군.... 특히 검은 색과 붉은 색의 조합을 통해 병사들을 좀 더 용감하고, 맹렬하게 싸울 수 있게 만들 수 있지. 뮤턴트들과 비교한다면, 나머지들은 그저 공원에서 산책하고 있는 것과 마찬가지일 뿐이다.\n \n자, 인간형 적을 마주한다면, 누군가는 볼 수 없다면 죽일 수도 없다는 생각을 해서 위장이 쓸모있을 거라고 평가할 수도 있겠지. 하지만 지금까지 이 지옥도를 걸어온 끝에, 우리들 듀티는 범죄자들이 우릴 마주한다고 해도, 그들이 볼 수 있는 건 바로 공포 그 자체라는 사실을 믿고 있다./text>

	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_4">
		<text>우리들 듀티와 프리덤과의 차이를 가르쳐 줄 짧은 이야기 하나를 들려 주지.\n \n2006년 당시, 로스토크는 무법 지대였다. 오늘날의 폐허 지역과 비슷하다고 보면 된다. 그럼에도 불구하고 우리 듀티는 이 곳에 기지를 차리게 되었지, 왜냐면 우린 로스토크가 한때는 공장이었던 사실을 알고 있었고, 이 시설을 복구할 뜻이 확고했기 때문이다.\n도착했을 때, 우린 들개들 한 무리로부터 벗어나 목숨을 부지하려 애쓰는 스토커 한 명을 발견했다. 우린 그 친구를 구한 뒤 응급처치를 했고, 난 이렇게 물어봤지, "이보게, 자네같은 젊은 친구가 이런 데서 뭘 하고 있는 건가?"\n 그리고 그 스토커는 이렇게 말했지, "네, 저는 한때 바텐더였습니다만, 깡패들에게 쫒기고 말았죠. 그래서 놈들에게서 도망쳐서 살기 위해 여기로 왔습니다."\n \n그리고 나서 내가 그 친구를 보니, 하도 손을 떠는 바람에 총도 제대로 쥘 수 없을 정도더군, 그 뒤에 내가 이야기했지, "그래, 자네는 제 때 찾아온 것 같군."\n 그 친구는 다시 바텐더가 돼서 일하기로 했고, 나와 같이 로스토크를 복구해서 지금의 모습으로 만들어냈지. 우리는 스토커들과 같이 일하면서, 존 안에서 아직 조금이나마 도움이 되는 것들을 복구하기 위해 각자 가진 기술들을 최대한 끌어내려고 애썼지.\n \n아, 하지만 이쯤에서 프리덤이 어디서 끼어들었는지 궁금해할 때가 된 거 같군. 그래, 2011년 쯤에 프리덤은 자기들 기지를 거의 못쓰게 만들어 놓았었지, 그래서 놈들은 거기서 나와서 새로운 기지를 탈취하려고 했다.\n놈들은 이상현상이 로스토크를 존의 다른 지역으로부터 고립시킬 때까지 기다렸다가, 그 틈을 타서 군 창고를 기습했고  국유지를 장악한 거지  and wrest it out the hands of its rightful owners. And what has become of the Warehouses since then? Since Freedom took control, that once-proud bastion has devolved into nothing but bullets and anarchy, and the exploratory vehicles that used to brave the unknown have long since decayed into rust.\n \nFreedom promises liberty, but in the long run they bring only ruin. It's only a matter of time before they burn out too.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_5">
		<text>I suppose I can give you some insight into Duty's oath. It's really quite simple.\n \n"I, a stalker known as Voronin,\nSwear to defend the goals and ideals of Duty.\nTo protect the Earth from the dangers of the Zone, to seek out and destroy anything it spawns within and beyond its borders.\nTo fight any nonconformists, be they individual stalkers or groups.\nAnd to give my life in the name of justice and order on Earth!"\n \nThose are the words I swore, along with Petrenko, when I first joined all those years ago. It's why we don't seek artefacts for our own benefit, instead giving them to Barkeep or the Ecologists, who are the only ones we can trust to handle the artefact trade responsibly. It's why we battle against bandits, mercs and Freedom, who all seek to exploit the innocent or naively spread the Zone's "gifts" without precaution or forethought. Although we do not exempt common stalkers from such crimes, in their case we believe in innocence until guilt is proven, unlike the trigger-happy dogs under Kuznetsov's command.\n \nBut battling against the misguided is only secondary to our true goal: contain the Zone, and push it back. This means killing the mutants it creates, destroying its most dangerous artefacts, and dissipating its anomalies when we can.\n \nFor the sake of future generations, we help willing traders uphold standards to moderate artefact-handling and reduce risk... standards that corner-cutting mercs ignore for the sake of profit.\n \n The final part of our code emphasizes the individual's place within humanity's greater whole; we are all working towards a higher cause in Duty, and it is sweet and fitting to give one's life in service to humanity's defence.\n \nLieutenant-Colonel Shulga understood that last part better than anyone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_6">
		<text>Unlike the anarchists north of us, Duty understands the value of self-policing, and all members hoping for promotions are instilled with a firm belief in discipline and internal integrity.\n \nIn our eyes, a bad act does not wash out the good... nor a good the bad. They exist alongside one another, and we must judge each for what they are.\n \nSo, when we stumble and fail to police ourselves, such as with this one shameful case in Zaton many years ago, we make amends and hold ourselves accountable as best we can.\n \nIn some cases, even to our enemies. Many years ago, a talented Duty squad took a young-ish Freedom group prisoner, and marched them back into Rostok for interrogation. The Dutyers involved were to be commended for their cunning... that is, until our faction's investigators uncovered gross misconduct within the squad. Yes, Duty and Freedom are at war, but what that squad did to their prisoners... what those maggots had done was inexcusable.\n \nEach Dutyer involved was dishonourably discharged, we did our best to scrub the deceitful smut they'd recorded of their prisoners off the PDA network, and justice was served. Duty occupies a position of trust, and it is a position we earn through our will to do what is right, even if at times it means sacrificing strategic expedience. The Zone is a reflection of the evils within all of us. We cannot fight it if we also choose to feed it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_7">
		<text>Occasionally, I hear cynics muttering, asking why Duty still needs fighters... why we're still needed in this world. Whenever I hear this question, I always give the same answer...\n \nBefore, the most dangerous mutants only stalked underground; they were just the stuff of legends. Now, I have reports of Snorks in Dark Valley, Controllers walking the surface, even the occasional Bloodsucker in Cordon. The Zone is growing and, unless its expansion is curbed, its horrors will spread across the globe, like a disease.\n \nThe military has sworn to ensure nothing breaches the Zone's current borders, yet most of the soldiers waste their time harassing harmless stalkers instead of battling the true threat. With our nation's defence force becoming increasingly misguided and corrupt, the burden of protecting the world from the Zone has fallen squarely to us. If not us, then who else?</text>

Before that, before the Zone came into existence, I was a car mechanic.

		<text>Well, you're probably already familiar with everything south of here. Right now, you're in Rostok. It's completely safe if you're on good terms with Duty. East is the Truck Cemetery - like the Garbage, but much bigger, much more radioactive and much, much more dangerous. West is the Wild Territory - the parts of Rostok that Duty can't patrol regularly. That place is an absolute nightmare, and most stalkers recommend avoiding it unless you need to get to Yantar. North are the Army Warehouses, owned by Duty's "best friend", Freedom. Further north than that quickly becomes Monolith territory, defended by ruthless fanatics and brain-melting anomalous fields.</text>

		<text>Allegedly, they are the guardians of an ancient alien crystal known as the "Wish Granter". The Monolith believe this crystal created the Zone, and that it will grant wishes to those it finds worthy. To this end, they'll fiercely defend it from anyone who dares step further than the northern Barrier at Army Warehouses. Of course, there are legends of people being found worthy of the Wish Granter, but it's all bullshit. There are easier ways to get rich, and you'd think by now someone would've wished for the mutants here to disappear, or for an end to disease, or even world peace - ha! But... I guess by the time you reach the Wish Granter, you don't give a shit about anyone else.  </text>

There have been constant disputes about what they are, but old satellite imagery suggests some kind of weird infrastructure, in whose honor the entire area was named. Apparently, that's the place where Monolith carry out their orders and all important processes on the territory of the Zone. So, the stalker's already gone there and I think he's serious - his intervention might have a major impact on the Zone.

		<text>I have a very special contact who is offering a huge reward for taking down ten stalkers. Fifty grand, plus sweets. Sounds like great cash for a simple list of bounties, right? Here's the interesting part: your targets just happen to be the top ten stalkers in the entire Zone. This means you could be hunting down regulars, Dutyers, mercs or even the fucking Monolith themselves! You can see the list on your PDA if you want. This guy wants them dead, doesn't matter how.</text>

	<string id="st_top_10_task_about_dialog_61">

		<text>No thanks, I'm out of this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_top_10_task_about_dialog_7">
		<text>I asked my contact something similar. Well, he said he's tired of walking dreadnoughts vaccuuming up all the loot with their fancy rifles and expensive suits. He wants to give the common man more of a chance. Anyways, the pay will be incredible, so who cares?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_top_10_task_about_dialog_8">
		<text>Fantastic! I will upload the location of your first target onto your PDA. Every time you kill one of them, you get the location of the next guy. Have fun.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_top_10_task_about_dialog_9">
		<text>Suit yourself. The offer is still there if you change your mind.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="st_top_10_task_finish_dialog_0">
		<text>Okay Snitch. It's done. Those ten targets are as good as dead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_top_10_task_finish_dialog_1">
		<text>Splendid work, pal! Our client is very happy with your results. As promised, here's your reward. Glad you were up to it after all - even now, I can hear people talking about your deeds. The killer of legends! This is gonna shake things up a bit, hehe...</text>

		<text>I'm the local sawbones, although I used to just be a paramedic. Lieutenant Sostradov's the name, but the stalkers around here call me Aspirin. Yeah, really. I've gotten quite good at treating a wide range of illnesses and injuries over the years. I also act as the resident pharmacist - after all, you need some meds with you in the field if you hope to return alive for proper treatment. </text>

		<text>How does anyone come to be in Duty? The Zone takes something from you. And then it takes again, and then again. Until you have nothing left but the Zone itself. Medic or no, that's how a stalker comes to be in Duty.\n \nWe're the ones who lost everything to this hellhole, yet stuck around to keep others from suffering the same fate. Of course, most Dutyers choose to protect people by trying to kill the Zone. That's not me.\n \nI'm here to undo all the injuries it leaves on people. To make sure the stalkers of this town get to live another day when their friends drag their bloodied bodies through the streets from whatever fool expedition they went on.\n \nAs long as you get yourself back here alive, I'll make you feel good as new. I won't even overcharge you, unlike some other traders around here.</text>

		<text>Who do you have for me to fight?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_11">
		<text>So, your first fight? Your opponent is a piece of meat just like you. He's here because of his debts and he only has two options: to come out and fight, or to land himself in the nearest anomaly. He's gonna fight like a cornered animal. Equipment for today... Lemme think... How about you two use basic pistols, two boxes of ammo should be plenty. Either kick his ass or we feed you to the dogs - not much of a choice. Go on now.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_12">
		<text>Your last fight didn't mean shit, you're still the same piece of meat you were before and no self-respecting person will bet a single mag on you. If you wanna earn some proper cash you're gonna have to make a few more appearances in the arena. Your new opponent also got through the first round, and his fight was a lot harder than yours. I don't like him, to be honest - he kills too quickly and the crowd doesn't like that. So, go and show us what you can do! The stakes will increase after this fight - all you gotta do is stay alive. Move it!</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_13">
		<text>Well, well... You're not as much of a pussy as you first seemed. Now it's time to test you out in a real fight. You're up against two guys. The first one's called Swede and I don't remember the second one's name. They were paired up intentionally as they hate each other's guts so don't worry about them working as a team - they're more likely to shoot each other. Today is rifle day so don't let them get too close or we'll have to pick you up piece by piece. The odds are 10:1 so if you win you'll make a fair amount. Off you go!</text>

		<text>Well, now I can safely say that you're a fighter, a real fighter. Now it's time for a team fight. You get to fight with two rookies - two brothers - on your side. They haven't fought yet but they're brothers, so I had to put them into a team fight. I wouldn't expect any real help from them if I were you. You're fighting an experienced team, they're contenders for the final this season. A dangerous lot. They use different weapons but one has an automatic shotgun - be very careful with him. Good luck, pal... You're gonna need it.</text>

They're well armed and their armour is as good as you'd expect. Don't worry though, I ain't gonna leave you out in the rain, either. You'll get a vest used by Freedom - it's light so it won't slow you down. Go on, show them that stalkers ain't no whipping boys. Good luck!</text>

		<text>Time for you to show what you can do. Duty captured a group of bandits that had been causing problems for stalkers near Rostok. Duty took 'em at night so most of the bandits were taken alive. They were all gonna be executed anyway so I convinced Duty to give them a chance. If any of them survive, they'll go in the can outside the Zone, which is better than dying here. They've been given good gear, and there's six of them, so watch yourself. Go on now!</text>

		<text>Well, you're almost in the final. Now you'll be fighting a real stalker. He's alone but he's got an assault rifle and he's inside a protective suit. Catch one burst and you're toast. There will be a surprise that I can't tell you about too... Here's my advice: be prepared, it's gonna be tough. The winner makes it through to the final. Fight to the death, go!</text>

		<text>What are the rules?</text>
	</string>

		<text>Oh, the rules are pretty simple. I invented them myself. For challenges, there's a cage, and a mutant is let inside the cage. You pay money and tell me the time you need to kill the monster. If you make it - you win, if you don't - I win.\nBut for the main course, bandits and the Zone's other degenerates captured by Duty fight in the arena for their crimes. Some are just stalkers who fancy a fight, and not actually criminals, but whoever leaves the arena in the least amount of pieces gets a sizeable reward. If they keep on winning fights, then more stalkers will come to watch, and the combatants win larger rewards.</text>
