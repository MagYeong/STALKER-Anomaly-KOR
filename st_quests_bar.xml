		<text>Did you know the Zone is home to some really exceptional tanners and jewellers? Doesn't matter what mutant part you give them - skulls, claws, tusks, pelts, even kidney stones, they'll make something good out of it. So, if you're interested in helping these guys out, bring me a %s, and there'll be cash in your pocket.</text>

		<text>Yes, there is. Duty's ideals compel it to provide Rostok with affordable medical care. Given the state the Zone's in, believe me when I say every little bit is needed. So, if you find a %s, bring it to me. Not only will you be compensated for it, but I'll be able to expand the range of meds I can synthesize efficiently, which will benefit everyone.</text>
